# Data-structures-algorithms-Javascript

This project is about understanding, implementing and evaluating popular algorithms and data structures for common use cases in programming.

## Expository Language
This Repo's expository language for DSA is Javascript, there is a separate repo for DSA using Java as well.

## Algorithms
I will be covering the algorithms in the following areas:

- Searching
- Sorting

List of Algorithms
Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

Searching
- Binary search
- linear search

And we will also be discussing the Big O Notations for the time and space complexity in best, average and the worst case scenarios as well for these algorithms.
